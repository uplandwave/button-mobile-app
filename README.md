# Overview

This is a mobile game I built for both iPhone and Android. The game is simple as your press the buttons things happen and the game goes on. Right now this game is in the beginning phases but more inability will be added and if you have ideas reach out to me and share them.

I created this game because I have never built an app before and thought it would be super cool to try it out and it was. I really enjoyed building this and think it is fun to play.
